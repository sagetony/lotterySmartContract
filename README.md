# lotterySmartContract
My First Smart Contract Application, the smart contract is a lottery application where player register by stack 0.1 ether on the smart contract.

This smart contract was built using the Solidity programming language and the Remix development environment. It is designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain and provides a decentralized lottery system.

## Features
* Lottery participants can purchase tickets with Ethereum (0.1). 
* The minimum players for the contract is 3 players
* The contract automatically selects a winner after a specified deadline.
* The winner receives the entire prize pool.
* The contract owner can set the ticket price, the deadline for ticket purchases.

## Getting Started
To use this smart contract, you will need the following:

* A web3-enabled browser (e.g. Chrome with the MetaMask extension installed)
* An Ethereum wallet with some ETH to purchase tickets

## How to Use
* Open the Remix IDE and create a new Solidity file.
* Copy and paste the contents of the Lottery.sol file into the new file.
* Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler in Remix.
* Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network of your choice.
